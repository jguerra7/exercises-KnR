K&R Exercises
=============

My solutions for the exercises from Kernighan and Ritchie's famous book "The C Programming Language".

Please note that I read this book for educational purpose only. I already know quite a bit about C and C++ but try to force myself to solve the assignments with only the knowledge from the book.
